    {"unassigned_tasks":2,"assigned_tasks":0,"free_tasks":1022,"total":1024}

Note: `total = unassigned_tasks + assigned_tasks + free_tasks`

* unassigned_tasks: tasks delivered but not claimed by [`do_post`](do_post.md)
* assigned_tasks: tasks delivered and claimed [`do_post`](do_post.md) 
* free_tasks: the remaining amount of tasks that can be assigned, when a [`do_get`](do_get.md) request comes, its value will reduce by one, and the corresponding `unassigned_tasks` or `assigned_tasks` will increase by one.
* total: total size of task cache assigned.
