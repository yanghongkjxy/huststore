# huststore - High-performance Distributed Storage #
![huststore logo](res/logo.png)

`huststore` is a open source high performance distributed database system. It not only provides key-value storage service with extremely high performance, up to 100 thousand QPS, but also supports data structures like `hash`, `set`, `sorted set`, etc. Also, it can store **binary** data as value from a key-value pair, and thus can be used as an alternative of Redis.

In addtion, `huststore` implements a distributed message queue by integrating a special `HA` module, features including message Push Stream, and message Publish-SubScribe, these features can be used as replacements of the corresponding features in rabbitmq and gearman.

## Features ##
`huststore` has two core components, `hustdb` and `HA`. `hustdb` is a database engine developed by our own, in the fundamental architecture. `HA` is implemented as a `nginx` module. It is well-known that `nginx` is a industry-proven high quality code base, thus by inheriting it `huststore` gains the below advantages:

* High Throughput  
`hustdb` uses [libevhtp](https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp), a open source network library, as the inner network communication system, by incorporating it with high-performance storage engine, `hustdb` achieves a extremely high performance, the benchmark shows that `QPS` hits **100 thousand** and even more.

* High Concurrency  
Please refer to concurrency report of `nginx` for more details.

* High Availability  
`huststore` architecture provides `Replication` (master-master) and `load balance` support. Therefore, the availability of `HA` is guaranteed by `master-worker` design. When one of `worker` process is down, the `master` will load another `workder` process, since multiple `worker`s work independently, the `HA` is guaranteed to work steadily.
The fundamental design architecture of `huststore` guarantees the high availability, by using `master-master` architecture, when one of the storage node fails, `HA` module will re-direct the request to another living `master` node. Also, when a node failure happens, `HA` cluster will automatically re-balance the data distribution, thus avoid single point of failure.
In addition, `HA` cluster uses a distributed architecture design by incorporating LVS as the director, each `HA` node is separated and work independently. When one of the `HA` node is down, `LVS` will re-direct the request to other available `HA` node, thus avoids `HA`'s failure on single point node.

* Language-free Interface  
`huststore` use `http` as the communication protocol, therefore the client side implementation is not limited in any specific programming language.

* Persistence  
**You do not need to worry about the loss of data** as most of interfaces will persist data to disk.  

* Support Binary Key-Value  
* Support Version Clock
